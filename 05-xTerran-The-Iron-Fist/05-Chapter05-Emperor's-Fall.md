# Emperor's Fall

UED command center, near the outskirts of Augustgrad; capital city of Korhal

## Mission Briefing

> ADJUTANT:
>> Captain, Admiral DuGalle has ordered a final tactical meeting before the siege of Augustgrad commences. I'll patch you through to his war room.

> DUGALLE:
>> Ah, Captain, we've been expecting you. As you may have guessed, we are coordinating our final attack plans. You should know, that even though Mengsk cannot reinforce his numbers, his standing forces are substantial. Augustgrad is easily the most heavily fortified city in all of Dominion space. And remember that Mengsk is an accomplished tactician so you had best be wary of any counter attacks he may attempt.

- a: Emperor's Fall (Ground Zero)

> STUKOV:
>> Also, despite the fact that we have crippled his fleet of battlecruisers, we suspect that Mengsk will unload his nuclear silos whenever the opportunity presents itself. Keep security tight at all of your bases, and watch out for enemy Ghosts.

> DUGALLE:
>> That should cover it, Captain. Be careful and good luck. By the day's end, the Terran Dominion will be nothing more than a bad memory.

- b: Emperor's Fall (Birds of War)

> STUKOV:
>> And Captain, remember that although we disables Mengsk's nuclear capabilities, he still commands a large number of Battlecruisers. We suspect that he will use these ships against us at every turn. Be on your guard, Captain, Show this 'Emperor' what the UED thinks of his rule.

## Mission

_Destroy Mengsk's Command Center_

> ADJUTANT:
>> Captain, I'm tracking the Dominion flagship, Norad III, in low orbit. Emperor Mengsk may be attempting an escape. Receiving incoming transmission.

> MENGSK:
>> This is Emperor Mengsk of the Terran Dominion. I wish to parlay with your Executive Officer at once!

> DUGALLE:
>> So, the elusive Arcturus Mengsk at last. I was hoping to speak with you before we finished our business here. I am Admiral Gerard DuGalle, and I must commend you, Sir, for holding back our advance for so long as you have. You are indeed a worthy opponent.

> MENGSK:
>> My thanks to you, Sir. But you must know that your victory here means little to me. It might have taken me awhile, but I did overthrow the Confederacy. I'll overthrow your rule as well.

> DUGALLE:
>> That seems unlikely, Sir, seeing as how you'll publicly executed along with the rest of your ranking officers.

> MENGSK:
>> You wouldn't dare!

> DUGALLE:
>> Hah! The man who crowns himself 'Emperor' speaks to me of daring? You have far outlived your reputation 'citizen' Mengsk. Captain, prepare to take the Emperor into custody.

> RAYNOR:
>> You'll have to postpone those plans, gentlmen.

> ADJUTANT:
>> Sir, the rebel command ship, Hyperion, has just entered our sensor range. It is accompanied by a small Protoss fleet.

> DUGALLE:
>> What? Who are these intruders!

> MENGSK:
>> Jim Raynor... What the hell are you doing here?!

> RAYNOR:
>> I'm pullin' your ass out've the fire, Arcturus. So shut up and sit tight. Make no mistake about it; we've got us a serious score to settle, but right now a mutual acquaintance of ours wants you alive. Prepare your ships for dimensional recall.

> DUGALLE:
>> This is intolerable! They're escaping right out from under us! Track them! Track them!
