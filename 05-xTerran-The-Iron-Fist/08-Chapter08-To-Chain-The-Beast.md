# To Chain the Beast

UED flagship, Aleksander, low orbit over the planet Char

## Mission Briefing

> ADJUTANT:
>> Captain, with the Psi Disrupter's signal hampering the Zergs' communications to one another, the Swarms over Char have scattered in disarray, allowing the fleet to penetrate to the planet's surface. However, there it still a considerable number of defenders nestled around the fledgling Overmind.

> DUGALLE:
>> Alexei was right. The Disrupter is the key to victory here. If I had destroyed the machine as Duran suggested we would never have made it this far... Nevertheless, the time is upon us, Captain, to do what we came here for. We will claim the Overmind in the name of Humanity!

> ADJUTANT:
>> Be advised, Captain: our sensors have identified three cerebrates who constitute the core of the Overmind's defenses. Each cerebrate's distinct capabilities are still unknown, so process with extreme caution.

> DUGALLE:
>> Launch your forces and let not a Zerg survive! Once you have reached the Overmind and crushed its defenders, you are to send in specially trained medics who will pacify the creature with potent Neurostim drugs. Only then will our victory be assured.
>>
>> And Captain, remember that Duran is still out there somewhere. I'd venture a guess that his treachery has only just begun. Be careful and good luck. I am sure that this will be our finest hour.

## Objectives

- Bring a medic to each of the beacons surrounding the Overmind
- Kill Zerg cerebrates to weaken the Overmind's defenses

## Mission

> MARINE:
>> Sir, these sunken colonies aren't being effected by anything we hit 'em with. I'll bet there's one of those cerebrate critters pumpin' 'em full of energy nearby.

_Torrasque, the powerful Ultralisk arise (and when reincarnated)_

(Tortured roar!)

_Kill Torrasque the first time_

> MARINE:
>> Sir, we've just had a whole cargo-ship full of whoop-ass dumped on us! We ran into a new strain of ultralisk and it took a lot o' pepper to bring it down. To top it all off, our recon squad reports that the critter's been reincarnated by nearby cerebrate and is on its way back for more!

_Kill the Cerebrate who control the sunken colonies (red)_

> MARINE:
>> Sir, this cerebrate's been whacked! We shouldn't have any more trouble with those sunken colonies!

_Kill the Cerebrate who control Torrasque (brown)_

> MARINE:
>> Sir, we've eighty-sixed this cerebrate! We shouldn't run up against any smacked-up ultralisks anytime soon!

_Reach the perimeter around the Overmind_

> GHOST:
>> Captain, we've reached the perimeter of the Overmind's nesting area. We can launch the Med Team at any time, Sir.

_Bring 4 Medics to the beacons surrounding the Overmind_

> GHOST:
>> Captain, the medics are in place and are administering the Neurostim
 treatments to the Overmind.

 _A moment later_

 > DURAN:
 >> Uh, excuse me Admiral. But I'd like to introduce someone to you...

 > DUGALLE:
 >> Duran? You son of a bitch, what's the meaning of this?

 > KERRIGAN:
 >> Admiral DuGalle. I've heard a lot about you.

 > DUGALLE:
 >> Who the... What the hell are you?

 > KERRIGAN:
 >> I am Kerrigan. The Zerg you've killed here and the Overmind which you've come to collect... are mine. As is our mutual friend Lieutenant Duran. You see Admiral... there are a number of groups on this sector who fell that you involvement here causes certain complications. My Associates and I intent to make sure that your reign is short lived.

 > DUGALLE:
 >> You may find that difficult, you abomination, seeing as how I possess the means to disrupt your control of the Zerg.

 > KERRIGAN:
 >> Ah, you're referring to you vaunted Psi Disrupter. It won't last you forever, Admiral. Sooner or later, I'll destroy it. Then I'll show you what the Zerg are really capable of.
 >>
 >> Oh, and by the way, Admiral: Your friend Stukov was twice the man you are. I'm glad you saved me the trouble of having to kill him...
