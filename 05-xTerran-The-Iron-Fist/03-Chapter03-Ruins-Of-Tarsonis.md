# Ruins of Tarsonis

> UED Flagship Aleksander, low orbit over the planet Tarsonis; former capitol world of the Terran Confederacy

## Mission Briefing

> ADJUTANT:
>> Captain, the Dominion shipyards have been destroyed, and it seems that General Duke has withdrawn his forces from this quadrant. We have impressed most of the remaining Dylarian defense forces into the fleet and stand ready to move to the next phase of our invasion.

> STUKOV:
>> We've just received word from our research team that they've uncovered some kind of hidden weapons relay upon the planet Tarsonis. They report that it's called a Psi Disrupter, and that its purpose is somehow connected with the Zerg.

> DURAN:
>> Admiral, during the Zerg invasion of these colonies, the Confederacy had manufactured a number of portable machines called Psi Emitters which had the uncanny ability to lure Zerg to their signals. It was rumored that they had created a specialized emitter that could disrupt the Zerg's communications, but Emperor Mengsk was never able to find it.
>>
>> It appears that this Psi Disrupter is the machine he was looking for. I must humbly suggest to you, Admiral, that the Disrupter be destroyed as quickly as possible. If it should fall into the hands of the Dominion we could face some very serious problems.

> DUGALLE:
>> Hmm. A prudent call, Lieutenant. I am inclined to agree.

> STUKOV:
>> But Admiral, this device could insure our victory over the Zerg! It is foolhardy to discard such an advantage!

> DURAN:
>> Surely, Vice Admiral, you don't doubt the tenacity of your own fleet? Your Directorate forces will devastate the Zerg without the need for such a device.

> STUKOV:
>> Listen here, Lieutenant, I've had just about enough of your-

> DUGALLE:
>> This conversation is over, Alexei. Given the true nature of our mission to enslave the Overmind, we could hardly stand to have Mengsk control a device of this magnitude. This Psi Disrupter must be destroyed in order to safeguard our mission. Ensign, set your course for Tarsonis.

## Objectives

> - Bring Duran to the Psi Disrupter
> - Duran must survive

## Mission

> DROPSHIP:
>> Go ahead, HQ.

> DUGALLE:
>> Lieutenant Duran, since you have shown such concern for this device's inherent danger, I charge you with finding the Disrupter and securing it. We will commence with its destruction once we've cleared the area.

> ADJUTANT:
>> Captain, our sensors are tracking Zerg signals in every direction. It appears that our intelligence was correct.

> DURAN:
>> Admiral, if we focus on destroying all of the hives in this area, we may able to neutralize these Zerg without too much trouble.

> NEW MISSION OBJECTIVES:
> - Destroy Zerg hives to disable Zerg broods
> - Bring Duran to the Psi Disrupter after Zerg hives are destroyed
> - Duran must survive

_Destroying the first Hive_

> DURAN:
>> Just as I thought. This brood can't operate without its primary hive cluster.

_Destroying all Hives_

> DURAN:
>> Captain, we've located the Psi Disrupter. Shall we plant the explosives on it?

> GHOST:
>> Lieutenant Duran, we're here to relieve you. We've come with orders from Admiral Stukov himself to facilitate the Disrupter's disassembly.

> DURAN:
>> Very well. Take it away. Captain, I'll be returning to the command ship presently.
