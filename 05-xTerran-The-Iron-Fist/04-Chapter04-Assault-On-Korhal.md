# Assault on Korhal

> UED Flagship Aleksander, low orbit over the planet Korhal; Dominion throne-world

## Mission Briefing

> DUGALLE:
>> Captain, once again your leadership has set a fine example to the rest of my officers. Vice Admiral Stukov has informed me that the Psi Disrupter has been accounted for, so we can now proceed with the next phase of our operation. The time has come to begin our primary invasion of the Dominion Throne-world of Korhal. Alexei, fill the Captain in on the current situation.

> STUKOV:
>> As you may know from your research, Captain, Korhal was a hotbed of anti-Confederate sentiment for years. The Confederacy hoped to contain Korhal's civil unrest by decimating it and its population with a massive nuclear barrage. Though the radiation levels on the planet are at an all time low, its surface is now nothing more than a smoldering desert.

> DURAN:
>> The catch, Admiral, is that because this world has already been devastated by nuclear fire, Mengsk has no compunction against using Nukes on us. We have detected a large cluster of missile silos on the outskirts of Augustgrad. If those silos were destroyed, we believe that mengsk would lose his core nuclear capabilities.

> STUKOV:
>> We also face a different obstacle, Captain. Intelligence has informed us that Mengsk employs multiple battlecruisers for his planetary defense. It is possible to nullify these battlecruisers by taking out strategic physics labs. Without these labs, Mengsk will be unable to power-up his ships' weapons system.

> DUGALLE:
>> Though we know how to compensate for Mengsk's defenses, we don't have enough time to follow through on them both. Therefore, Captain, you must choose to either counter his nuclear capabilities or his battlecruisers. Once you've taken care of this operation, we can begin to plan our final assault against Augustgrad.

## Objectives

## Mission

_Destroying the Physics Labs_

> STUKOV:
>> Superbly done, Captain. Mengsk's battlecruisers are now effectively powerless. He won't be able to use them against us when we assault his palace.

_Destroying the Nuclear Silos_

> STUKOV:
>> Well done, Captain. We don't need to worry about nukes when we siege Mengsk's palace.
