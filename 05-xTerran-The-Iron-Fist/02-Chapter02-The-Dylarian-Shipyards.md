# The Dylarian Shipyards

> UED Flagship Aleksander, holding perimeter orbit over the Dylarian Shipyards, outlying Dominion trade center

## Mission Briefing

> ADJUTANT:
>> Receiving incoming transmission.

> DUGALLE:
>> Captain, Vice Admiral Stukov has informed me of your flawless sortie upon Braxis. I must commend you for beginning our campaign with such a decisive victory. Our Tac Teams have decrypted the Dominion's datalink and have gained access to Mengsk's most guarded files. However, our work is not yet complete.
>>
>> We have ascertained the location of the Dylarian shipyards. These shipyards, serving as a fueling and repair station for the Dominion, house a number of functional Battlecruisers in dry-dock. To assure that our domination of this sector remains uncontested, you are to assault the shipyards and liberate as many of these capital ships as possible.

> DURAN:
>> Gentlmen, I recommend that you launch this attack using the utmost caution. Dominion Command can typically reinforce its outlying bases within sixteen standard hours. You should expect some sort of reprisal from Emperor Mengsk shortly.

> DUGALLE:
>> Ah, the Turncoat. I suggest that you pay keen attention to rank when you address the Captain and myself, Lieutenant Duran. Is that understood?

> DURAN:
>> Of course, Admiral.

> STUKOV:
>> Heh heh. You're beginning to show your age, Gerard. Give the boy some credit. He just tipped us off to a preeminent attack.

> DUGALLE:
>> However useful he may prove to be, Alexei, he will always be a traitor in my eyes. And you know that I cannot abide a traitor.

> STUKOV:
>> Only too well, Gerard. Captain, when you are ready, you may commence with the operation. Once you have commandeered the enemy's battlecruisers, be prepared to repel the Dominion reinforcements when they arrive.

## Objectives:

> - Steal battlecruisers
> - Defeat the Dominion strike force

## Mission

> STUKOV:
>> Once your forces have landed, Captain, you'll need to escort our pilots to the battlecruisers themselves. They will be able to commandeer the ships and turn them over to our control.

_After the first squad landed_

> MEDIC:
>> All right, troops, listen up! Each squad will have a Medic assigned to it to patch up the wounded. But that doesn't mean you can get careless! Stay frosty and get the job done!

_After the third squad landed_

> GHOST:
>> Sir, the nuke silos are secured. We've got four nukes on standby, awaiting your orders.

_After the forth (last) squad landed_

> MARINE:
>> Heads up, we got company!

> SIEGE TANK:
>> We gotta shake this lockdown pronto! Medic! Restore us!

_Finished acquiring Battlecruisers from all docks_

> ADJUTANT:
>> Captain, we are tracking a large fleet of Dominion ships in your vicinity.

> DUGALLE:
>> Ahh, this must be the reinforcements that Lieutenant Duran warned us about. Captain, prepare our newly acquired fleet to battle the intruders!

_Finished preparing the Battlecruisers (or just 50 seconds later...)_

> ADJUTANT:
>> Captain, we are being hailed by the Dominion flagship, Norad III.

> DUKE:
>> Well, now. I don't know which militia you are all from, but I advise ya' to back down... NOW! I'm General Edmund Duke of the Dominion armada. And in the name of Emperor Mengsk, I order you to surrender your forces immediately and unconditionally.

> STUKOV:
>> Ah, General Duke. I expected your forces to arrive sooner. You should know that we represent not one of your rag-tag peasant Militias, but the combined might of the United Earth Directorate.

> DUKE:
>> Earth Directorate? You mean to tell me you've come all they way out here from Earth?

> STUKOV:
>> That is correct, General. We're here to take control over this sector and its occupants for the betterment of mankind.

> DUKE:
>> Over my dead body. I don't care hwere yer' from, son. No one pushes around the Terran Dominion on my watch! All units, fire at will!
