# Emperor's Flight

> UED flagship, Aleksander, en route to the planet Aiur

## Mission Briefing

> ADJUTANT:
>> Captain, we have tracked the fugitives Mengsk and Raynor to the devastated Protoss homeworld of Aiur. Apparently, these two have taken shelter within a fortified Protoss encampment that lies at the base of a fully functional warp gate.

> DUGALLE:
>> I don't understand this. Why would the Protoss harbor these men?

> STUKOV:
>> I have no idea, Gerard, but the Protoss aren't our only problem. Our sensors have identified multiple Zerg broods surrounding the Protoss base. Presently, the broods seem to be passive, but there's no telling what might set them off. Should the broods attack, we'd be hard pressed to hold them at bay.

> DUGALLE:
>> I see. It is a risk we'll need to take. Mengsk represents a considerable threat to our agenda and must be eliminated. Captain, you will focus your attack against the rebel command center in the middle of the Protoss encampment. That must be where Mengsk and Raynor are hiding. We will deploy our own Valkyrie frigates and tighten up our air defenses. Vice Admiral Stukov and Lieutenant Duran will provide cover for your forces, and insure that no external threats interfere with your mission.

## Objectives

> - Destroy Raynor's command center

## Mission

_Awhile after establishing a base_

> STUKOV:
>> Captain, the warp gate at the center of the Protoss encampment has been activated! Our sensors show that the gate's energies are inciting the Zerg to attack. Be prepared for anything, Captain.

_After destroying Raynor's Command Center_

> STUKOV:
>> Good work, Captain. The command center is destroyed, but it looks like Mengsk and Raynor will try to escape through the warp gate. Make ready to move in and intercept their vessel before...
>>
>> Wait, I've just picked up multiple Zerg signals soming in from the northeast. That's Duran's position, but he seems to have moved his forces out of place! Lieutenant Duran, this is Stukov! Come in! I'm tracking a massive Zerg swarm in your quadrant! Respond, damn it!

> DURAN:
>> That is strange, Vice Admiral. My scanners don't show any Zerg at all. Maybe you have a technical problem with your equipment?

> STUKOV:
>> Lieutenant, if these Zerg get through, we'll never be able to capture Mengsk! I'm giving you a direct order to return to your position and reinforce my troops!

> DURAN:
>> Oh, I'm sorry sir, but it seems your signal's... fading out. I couldn't... make out that last part. I'll try to... reestablish contact later.

> STUKOV:
>> Duran! Captain, your position will be overrun by superior Zerg numbers within fifteen minutes. I suggest you retreat back to the fleet immediately. Inform Admiral DuGalle that I have a personal matter to take care of...
