# Patriot's Blood

UED flagship, Aleksander, holding perimeter orbit over the planet Braxis

## Mission Briefing

> ADJUTANT:
>> Admiral, the fugitive Mengsk and Raynor escaped through the warp gate due to the intervention of the Zerg. But shortly before our forces were overrun, Vice Admiral Stukov took control of a large contingent of troops and came here to the planet Braxis.

> DUGALLE:
>> Why would he abandon the battle on Aiur?
>>
>> Why has he come back to Braxis?

> DURAN:
>> I mean no offense, Admiral. But perhaps Stukov's loyalties are not as strong as you once believed.

> DUGALLE:
>> Because you are young and foolish, Lieutenant, I will pardon that insult. Alexi and I have been friends since long before you were born. However, he must be found. If Stukov is here, he will account for his actions.

> ADJUTANT:
>> Admiral, our sensors have detected a fully functional Psi Disrupter on the planet's surface directly below our position. It would appear that the Vice Admiral did not destroy the Psi Disrupter on Tarsonis as was ordered.

> DUGALLE:
>> What? Impossible!

> DURAN:
>> I warned you Admiral! Stukov has betrayed you! He's reconstructed the Psi Disrupter in order to sabotage your mission in this sector!

> DUGALLE:
>> I can't believe it. Yet the evidence is incontrovertible. Alexei, what have you done?
>>
>> Perhaps you've been right all along, Lieutenant. On my authority, enter the Psi Disrupter... and... deal with the Vice Admiral appropriately...

> DURAN:
>> Of course, Admiral.

>> Vice Admiral Stukov, I am here under orders to terminate your command.

> STUKOV:
>> Lieutenant Duran. I'm not suprised. We both know exactly what it is that you're here to terminate. Get on with it.

> DURAN:
>> Say goodnight, Stukov.

> STUKOV:
>> To hell with y- (gunshot) (gasp)!

> DUGALLE:
>> Lieutenant Duran, report your situation immediately!

> STUKOV:
>> Gerard... old friend. You do indeed have a traitor in your midst... but it's not me. Duran. He has been playing us both from the start... He convinced you to destroy the Psi Disrupter... even though it was our best chance at defeating the Zerg. And then, on Aiur, ...he allowed the Zerg to overrun us even as we had the fugitives in our grasp. I came here... to activate the one hope we have of defeating them... And you killed me for it. Heh, heh... Duran is your enemy Gerard. I suspect... that he may even be infested as well... Use the Disrupter, Gerard... Finish our operation... Let my death have at least some meaning.

> DUGALLE:
>> Alexei! No! What have I done? What have I done? Computer, where the hell is Lieutenant Duran?

> ADJUTANT:
>> The Lieutenant no longer registers on my sensors, Admiral. He appears to have vanished.

> DUGALLE:
>> No.

_A moment later_

> ADJUTANT:
>> Self-destruct sequence initiated.

> ADJUTANT:
>> Sir, the Disrupter's power core has just been set to overload. In order to prevent meltdown, you will need to reach the manual override terminal and shut the reactor core down.

> DUGALLE:
>> It must have been Duran. You men served the Vice Admiral loyally. I ask that you continue to serve his memory by keeping this Disrupter in one piece! Now get going and find that override terminal!

> NEW MISSION OBJECTIVE:
> - Get to the override terminal before time runs out.

> MARINE:
>> What the hell? How did Zerg get in here? Captain we may have a huge infestation problem.

> DUGALLE:
>> This proves that Duran's working with the Zerg! Captain, don't let a single Zerg stand in your way. We need this Disrupter now more than ever!
