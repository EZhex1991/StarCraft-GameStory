# First Strike

> Since the conflict began in the Koprulu sector, the ruling council of the United Earth Directorate has closely monitored its wayward Terran colonies. Having witnessed the steady advancement of the Zerg infestation and the maneuverings of the Protoss throughout the Colonies, the ruling council has finally agreed to take control over the war-torn sector.
>
> Learning that a new Zerg Overmind has manifested itself upon the planet Char, the UED has sent its greatest Admiral, Gerard DuGalle, to capture the creature. As Captain of the UED fleet under DuGalle, your objective will be to storm the Terran Dominion and depose of its dictator, Emperor Mengsk I.

## Mission Briefing

> ADJUTANT:
>> Adjutant online. Good morning, Captain. Our long voyage from Earth is over, and we are holding a stationary position near the borders of Dominion space. I trust that the effects from your long cold sleep have worn off by now. If not, the Med Officer can provide you with additional CryoStim supplements. Admiral DuGalle has issued a proclamation to the entire fleet via transmat. I'll patch it through to you now.

> DUGALLE:
>> Attention! Defenders of the United Earth Directorate, this is Admiral DuGalle. You were all briefed before we left Earth, so you know that we have come here to conquer this sector in the name of Humanity. Should any of you have second thoughts about performing your assigned duties, be reminded that if we fail in our mission here, not one of us will be going home. We stand or fall together in this forsaken wastedland!
>>
>> Serve the Directorate. Serve Humanity. All other priorities are secondary to victory! DuGalle out.

> ADJUTANT:
>> Transmat completed. Receiving incoming transmission:

> STUKOV:
>> Good morning, Captain. I am Vice Admiral Stukov, tactical advisor to Admiral DuGalle. I see you've already reviewed his proclamation. I'm sure it doesn't cover anything you weren't already familiar with. Once you get to know the Admiral, I'm sure you'll find that he's actually quite personable.
>>
>> At any rate, Captain, I do have orders for you. As we are about to begin our invasion of the Dominion, we will need access to their primary data net and weapons diagnostics. To this end, you are to assault the outlying planet of Braxis, and take control of its capital city of Boralis. You are to deploy your forces within two standard hours. The Admiral expects perfect results, Captain. Stukov out.

## Objectives

- Destroy the enemy command center

## Mission

> MARINE:
>> Ah, crap! This landing site doesn't have any gas! Guess we better start looking for another geyser.

_Meeting with Duran_

> DURAN:
>> Captain, I am Lieutenant Samir Duran of the Confederate Resistance Forces. I've been monitoring your attack against the Dominion, and I'd like to offer you my services and skills in return for amnesty.

> STUKOV:
>> Intriguing. Lieutenant, you have absolutely no ideas as to who we are or what we have come here to do. Why do you wish to side with us?

> DURAN:
>> Because my men and I have sworn to fight against the Dominion and its Emperor. Seeing as how your forces have been laying into this Dominion base, I figured we were on the same side.

> STUKOV:
>> I see. How exactly do you propose to be of service to us, Lieutenant?

> DURAN:
>> Well, I possess intimate knowledge of the surrounding area. I can show you an alternate route that leads to the rear of the main Dominion base.

> STUKOV:
>> Very well, Lieutenant. Consider yourself and your men the first colonial conscripts of the United Earth Directorate. Captain, see that the Lieutenant is given our full cooperation. We shall see if he's worth the effort.

> ADDITIONAL MISSION OBJECTIVE:
> - Duran must survive.

_Destroy the enemy Command Center_

> DURAN:
>> Mission successful, Admiral.

> STUKOV:
>> Excellent, Lieutenant. This planet's primary defenses are now crippled. Our Tac Teams can now begin to decode the Dominion's security datalink.
