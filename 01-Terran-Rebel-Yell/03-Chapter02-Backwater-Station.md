# Mission

RAYNOR:

> Glad to see you, boys. Time to kick some serious butt.

_Bring unit to Zerg colony_

RAYNOR:

> What the hell is that? Looks like the ground there is alive.

_Bring unit to bunker and rescue base_

RESCUED SCV:

> Thanks for the rescue. We've been holed up in these bunkers for days hiding from the Zerg!

RAYNOR:

> These things have been out here a while. But they could be pretty useful.

_Bring unit to rescue Command Center_

RESCUED FIREBAT:

> Need a light?

_Bring unit to Infested Command Center_

MARINE:

> What the hell did they do to that Command Center?

RAYNOR:

> Whatever it is, it ain't natural. Burn it, boys.

_After destroying Infested Command Center_

ADVISOR:

> Receiving incoming transmission...

DUKE:

> Marshal Raynor, by destroying a vital Confederate installation, you and your men have violated standing colonial law. As of right now, you're all under arrest. I suggest you throw down your weapons and come peaceably.

RAYNOR:

> Are you outta your mind? If we hadn't burned that damn factory, this entire colony could have been overrun! Maybe if you hadn't taken your sweet time in getting here -

DUKE:

> Now I asked you nice the first time, boy. I didn't come here to talk with you. Now throw down them weapons!

RAYNOR:

> Guess you wouldn't be a Confederate if you weren't a complete pain in the ass.
