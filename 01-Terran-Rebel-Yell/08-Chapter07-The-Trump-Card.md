# The Trump Card

Secret Staging Area  
Antiga Prime Colony

## Mission Briefing

> ADVISOR:
>> Commander, our position has been discovered. As of two hours ago, a large Confederate strike force arrived on Antiga Prime and established a base camp within our defensive perimeter. Arcturus Mengsk is calling a meeting.

> MENGSK:
>> Greetings. I know you're all concerned about the Confederate strike force, but first we have a grave matter to discuss. It seems our data discs didn't hold weapon designs after all. Lieutenant Kerrigan will explain.

> KERRIGAN:
>> You all know that the Confederates run a program for psychically gifted humans, training them to be Ghosts. Those running the program found that the Zerg are attuned to the psychic emanations of Ghosts.

> RAYNOR:
>> So the Zerg are here for you, darlin'? This keeps gettin' better and better.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Shut up. There's been a lot of secret Confederate research surrounding Ghosts and the Zerg. What we stole was a small but critical piece of the puzzle: designs for a Transplanar Psionic Waveform Emitter. The emitters broadcast the neural imprint of a Ghost, but at a much greater magnitude. These things reach accross worlds.

> MENGSK:
>> The Confederacy used these Psi Emitters to lure the Zerg into isolated containment areas. Your colony - Mar Sara - Commander, was one such location.

> RAYNOR:
>> What are you saying?

> MENGSK:
>> I'm saying the Zerg are a secret weapon developed by the Confederacy. I'm saying you were all subjects of a Confederate weapons test.
>>
>> Just as They destroyed Korhal with nuclear weapons to establish dominance a generation ago, they would use the Zerg to put an end to their other rivals. Only this time there'd be no outrage: who could suspect the aliens were their creation? No, they'd be lauded as heroes for coming in and destroying the Zerg. It's time the Confederacy paid for its crimes.
>>
>> And I know just the way. Lieutenant Kerrigan is going to plant an emitter at the Confederate base camp. Commander, you will provide her with an escort. When the Zerg arrive, they'll break the blockade for us and we'll make our escape. Now get moving.

## Objectives:

- Bring the Psi Emitter to the enemy base
- Kerrigan must survive

## Mission

> KERRIGAN:
>> I'm having doubts about this, Arcturus. I just don't think anyone deserves to have the Zerg unleashed on them.

> MENGSK:
>> I know you have personal feelings about this, but you can't let your past cloud your judgement. Carry out your orders, lieutenant.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Yes, sir.

> TIP:  
> Use the Liftoff command to move your buildings.

_After successfully bring the Psi Emitter to enemy base_

> KERRIGAN:
>> Psi-Emitter in place. Just promise me we'll never do anything like this again.

> MENGSK:
>> We will do whatever it takes to save humanity. Our responsibility is too great to do any less.
