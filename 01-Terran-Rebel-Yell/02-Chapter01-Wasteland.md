# Wasteland

Office of the Colonial Magistrate
Mar Sara Colony

## Mission Briefing

ADVISOR:

> ADVISOR online. Good evening, Magistrate. I'll fill you in on what's been happening: Confederate traffic has increased substantially within the system due to the recent Protoss destruction of the Chau Sara Colony. The Confederates have tightened security on all outlying systems, and it's likely that this colony will be locked-down as well. An encrypted Confederate transmission came for you while you were at dinner. Replaying transmission:

DUKE:

> Greetings, Magistrate. I'm General Edmund Duke of the Confederate Security Forces, Alpha Squadron. The Confederacy has quarantined this entire planet, and we'll proceed with the lock-down within 48 hours. You're to relocate your core colonists to the outlying wastelands, Now I know there won't be any problems with these new arrangments.

ADVISOR:

> Transmission ended. I have contacted the local Marshal, James Raynor. Raynor has agreed to meet your personnel en route and escort them to the new wasteland site.

## Objectives

- Find Raynor
- Build a Barracks
- Train 10 Marines
