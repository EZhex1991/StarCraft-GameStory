## Mission Briefing

> ADVISOR:
>> Receiving incoming transmission. Com-link established:

> DUKE:
>> I got your message, Magistrate, and frankly I don't care what you have to say about Confederate regulations. You damn fringe world yokels are all alike, don't know where your loyalties lie. Y'all have a real good day now, y'hear?

> ADVISOR:
>> Transmission ended. The report you requested is ready. Sixteen outland stations have reported sightings of the alien invaders indentified as Zerg. The Confederates have arrested all standing militia forces and continue to avoid action against the Zerg. There stations have fallen to the Zerg already. We've been unable to locate any source of military relief except... the extremist faction known as The Sons of Korhal. Their liaison is holding on line.

> MENGSK:
>> Good day, Magistrate. My name is Arcturus Mengsk, and I represent The Sons of Korhal. You're familiar with the Confederate propaganda surrounding my group, but your reputation suggests you'll see past it. It's never been our practice to operate in any one place for long, but these Zerg don't look like they're going to wait. I'm going to make you an offer, Magistrate. I'd like to help you out by sending down a number of transports to your colony and evacuating any survivors.
>>
>> You know, of course, that my organization operates outside the bounds of Confederate law. That's why they spread their lies and misinformation. If you decide to accept our help, you'll be branded as an outlaw too. But, it's a chance to save the people. Time to make a stand, Magistrate.

> ADVISOR:
>> Ending transmission. Priority Alert! Evacuation Zone under attack by Zerg forces. Distress beacon activated at 1220.
