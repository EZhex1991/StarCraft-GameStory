# Norad II

Secret Staging Area  
Antiga Prime Colony

## Mission Briefing

ADVISOR:

> It appears that the Confederates are in a state of panic about the Antigan revolt. I'm picking up a high number of Confederate transmissions going back and forth between their outposts and their headquarters on Tarsonis. Most of the transmissions are heavily coded, but wait, here's something:

DUKE:

> This is General Duke calling from Alpha Squadron Flagship Norad II! We've crash-landed and are being hit hard by the Zerg! Request immediate backup from anyone receiving this signal! Repeat, this is a priority one distress call-

RAYNOR:

> Zerg? Here? Serves 'em right. 'Bout time they got a taste of what it's like to be in there mixin' it up.

MENGSK:

> Jim, I want you to move in and save the base.

RAYNOR:

> I'm positive I didn't hear that right.

KERRIGAN:

> Arcturus, have you lost your mind?

MENGSK:

> Listen, I know Duke's a cold hearted bastard, but en entire colony shouldn't have to suffer for that. Besides, a Confederate general could prove to be a powerful ally. This is an opportunity we cannot miss.

KERRIGAN:

> I don't like this at all.

MENGSK:

> I'm not asking you to like it. I'm asking you to do it.

KERRIGAN:

> Yes, Sir.

RAYNOR:

> Great. Let's get this over with.

## Objectives

- Protect Battlecruiser Norad II
- Bring Raynor and 2 dropships to Norad II

## Mission

_Arrived at the base_

NOTE:

> A Terran building with hit points "in the red" will burn down unless it is repaired.

_Beginning of the mission_

RAYNOR:

> If we're doin' this, we'd better hurry. That ship won't last long against those Zerg.

_Bring Raynor and 2 dropships to Norad II_

DUKE:

> You're about the last folks I expected to show up. What's your angle here, Mengsk?

RAYNOR:

> Our angle? I'll give you an angle, you slimy Confederate piece of -

MENGSK:

> Jim, enough! I'll handle this. The Confederacy is falling apart, Duke. Its colonies are in open revolt. The Zerg are rampaging unchecked. What would have happened here today if we hadn't shown up?

DUKE:

> Your point?

MENGSK:

> I'm giving you a choice. You can return to the Confederacy and lose, or you can join us and help save our entire race from being overrun by the Zerg. I don't think it's a diffult decision.

DUKE:

> Join forces? With you? I'm a general, for God's sake!

MENGSK:

> A general without an army. I'm offering you a position in my cabinet, not just some backwater post. Don't test my patience, Edmund.

DUKE:

> All right, Mengsk. You've got a deal.

MENGSK:

> You've made the right choice, General Duke.

RAYNOR:

> I can't believe you're really going to trust this snake!

MENGSK:

> Don't worry, Jim. He's our snake now.
