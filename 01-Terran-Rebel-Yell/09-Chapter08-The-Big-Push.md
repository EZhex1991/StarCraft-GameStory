# The Big Push

> The Zerg, lured by the Psi Emitter's signal, descended upon the unsuspecting Confederate forces and annihilated them.
>
> Once again, the Protoss fleet, under the command of High Templar Tassadar, arrived and incinerated the planet.

Command Ship Hyperion  
Holding perimeter orbit over Confederate Captiol World Tarsonis

## Mission Briefing

ADVISOR:

> Greetings, Commander. Receiving incoming transmission:

MENGSK:

> The time of our final strike against the Confederacy is close at hand. Before we can strike at Tarsonis itself, however, we must break through the confederacy's most potent defenses. General Duke will brief you.

DUKE:

> I've defended Tarsonis in over thirty major battles, so I know its defenses inside and out. There are three primary orbital platforms that serve as staging areas for the Confederate fleet. If we assault the central platform, we should cause enough of a ruckus to allow a small force to break through the planetary defenses.

RAYNOR:

> General, I'm impressed. I never figured you for the frontal assault type.

DUKE:

> Well, the Confederates have Omega and Delta Squadron troops defending the platform. They're nothing compared to my Alpha Squadron boys.

RAYNOR:

> Right.

## Objectives

- Eliminate the Confederate forces
- Duke must survive

## Mission

_Bring Unit to landing area_

DUKE:

> I can't believe this! Alpha Squadron never would've left this equipment behind! That's what I call sloppy!

_Acquire Nuclear silo_

TIP:

> Use ghosts to target Nuclear Missiles.

_After wipe out the Confederate forces_

DUKE:

> This is Duke. The emitters are secured and on-line.

KERRIGAN:

> Who authoried the use of Psi-Emitters?

MENGSK:

> I did, lieutenat.

KERRIGAN:

> What? The Confederates on Antiga were bad enough, but now you're going to use the Zerg against an entire planet? This is insane.

RAYNOR:

> She's right, man. Think this through.

MENGSK:

> I have though it through. Believe me. You all have your orders. Carry them out.
