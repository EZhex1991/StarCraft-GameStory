# The Kel-Morian Combine

> Command ship Hyperion, orbiting the plane Moria

## Mission Briefing

> FENIX:
>> Now that the Psi Disrupter has been destroyed and Kerrigan has regained control of her minions, I fear that she will forget our pact and turn on us.

> RAYNOR:
>> I know what you mean, Fenix. I'd love to believe that she's on the level, but there's a part of me that just knows better. However, I do believe that she's serious about taking out the UED. The only real question left is what happens to us when she wins.

> MENGSK:
>> If you ask me, she's completely untrustworthy. But, so long as she'll help me retake Korhal, I'll work with her.

> RAYNOR:
>> Shut up, Arcturus. If I wanted your damn opinion, I would've beaten it out of ya'. And in case you forgot, you're the reason she became what she is in the first place!

> KERRIGAN:
>> You boys should really learn to play nice with each other.

> FENIX:
>> Kerrigan, are your forces ready to assault Korhal as we planned?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Nearly. I still need a substantial cache of resources in order to build up my primary hive clusters. I'm wondering if you gentlemen wouldn't mind going on a fuel raid for me?

> RAYNOR:
>> It sounds like you've already got a plan. What are ya' thinkin'?

> KERRIGAN:
>> I'm thinking that we should pay the Kel-Morian Combine a little visit. Moria is one of the largest resource nodes in the sector. If you can bypass their defenses, and steal enough resources from them, we'll be able to afford a full-scale assault on Korhal.

> RAYNOR:
>> It's risky, but I think we can handle it. Fenix, are you into this?

> FENIX:
>> If it betters our chances, I will lead the assault myself.

> RAYNOR:
>> Great. Let's get moving.

> DURAN:
>> Do you think they suspect anything, my Queen?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Of course. They aren't stupid, Duran. They're siding with the evil they know over the evil they don't... They simply don't yet realize what it will const them.

## Objectives

> - Obtain 10,000 minerals
> - Fenix must survive

## Mission

> KERRIGAN:
>> Cerebrate, I want you to infest as many Terran command centers as possible. Once they're infested, we'll be able to use them in our coming assault on Korhal.

> OPTIONAL MISSION OBJECTIVE:
> - Infest command centers for next mission

_Destroying enemy base near start location_

> FENIX:
>> It is difficult to believe that I am working along side my greatest enemy in order to save this sector. Fortune has been whimsical of late.

> RAYNOR:
>> You sound like a tired old man, Fenix!

> FENIX:
>> Don't let the fact that I am three hundred and sixty eight years older than you dull your impression of me, young Raynor. I can still... how do you Terrans say it... "Throw down with the best of them!"

> RAYNOR:
>> I stand corrected.

_Build a Hatchery_

> KERRIGAN:
>> Remember, Cerebrate, we'll need at least ten thousand units of crystals to maintain the hive clusters. Don't come back with anything less!

_Infest / Destroy first Command Center_

> FENIX:
>> It is strange that this Kel-Morian Combine continues to operate while the UED grips the Dominion with an iron fist. I'll never underestimate the motivational effects of Terran greed again!

_Infest / Destroy another Command Center_

> FENIX:
>> I prefer large scale battles over these covert mission. My heart longs for the epic struggles of my youth, to go into battle alongside my Protoss brethren again. Ah, but time will tell all things.

_Accumulate 10,000 minerals, or infest / destroy all Command Centers_

> FENIX:
>> Kerrigan, we have reached our resource quota, and will be returning to Tarsonis.
