> Kerrigan's base of operation

## Mission Briefing

> KERRIGAN:
>> The time is finally upon us, my minions, to destroy the wretched Overmind and the last of its Renegade Cerebrates. We can count on the UED providing us with heavy resistance, but not even they can stand in our way. Now that the Matriarch, Raszagal is in my custody, I possess the means to attack the Overmind with impunity.

> DURAN:
>> But my Queen, I thought only the Dark Templar's energies could harm the Overmind and its Cerebrates. Even with the numerous Broods at your command, any attack we launch against the Renegades will be in vain.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Not so, Duran. As a matter of fact, I'm expecting my secret weapon to be arriving very soon.

> DURAN:
>> As you say, my Queen. But I still don't understand wh-
>>
>> We are receiving a transmission from an unidentified Protoss Carrier...

> KERRIGAN:
>> That's what I love about the Protoss... They're so punctual.

> ZERATUL:
>> Kerrigan, this is Zeratul. I demand to know why you're taken our Matriarch.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Actually, Zeratul, she's not the one I'm truly interested in. I stole her to get to you. You see, I need you and your brethren to kill the Overmind for me. The only way I had of assuring your cooperation was to take away that which you value most. However, I give you my word that once you've killed the Overmind, I'll allow her to return to you.

> ZERATUL:
>> As if your world held any value...

> RASZAGAL:
>> Zeratul, my faithful servant. You must aid Kerrigan in this endeavor. The Overmind is our commen enemy. It must be destroyed to insure that our people will survive!

> ZERATUL:
>> You ask me to aid this vile creature?

> RASZAGAL:
>> I do not ask this for my self. Nor do I ask it on Kerrigan's behalf. I ask you to do this for our people, Zeratul. Obey me as you always have... Trust in my judgement.

> ZERATUL:
>> Very well, Matriarch. The Overmind will die this day.

## Objectives

> - Destroy the Overmind with Dark Templar
> - Must be able to have Dark Templar

## Mission

_Kill the Overmind_

> ZERATUL:
>> It's done, Kerrigan. The Overmind is dead as you wished. Now I demand that you release the Matriarch at once!

> KERRIGAN:
>> Of course. Raszagal, do you wish to return to your tribe?

> RASZAGAL:
>> No, my Queen. I wish only to serve you and remain at your side.

> ZERATUL:
>> What treachery is this, Kerrigan? This pathetic creature cannot possibly be Raszagal!

> KERRIGAN:
>> Ha ha ha. I promised that I'd allow her to return to you, Zeratul. But it looks to me like she doesn't want to go.

> ZERATUL:
>> You have corrupted her! Somehow you have poisoned her thoughts. Restore her to ther rightful self, or you will pay dearly for this offense, Kerrigan!

> KERRIGAN:
>> All right, Zeratul, you've got me. I made your Matriarch my slave long before I joined you on Shakuras. She made the mistake of underestimating my power just like everyone else did. And now she's paid the price.
>>
>> With her as my puppet I was able to eradicate the Renegades on Shakuras, and use you to kill the Overmind. And as you can see, Your leader belongs to me now. Not bad, huh?

> ZERATUL:
>> We shall see, Kerrigan. We shall see.
