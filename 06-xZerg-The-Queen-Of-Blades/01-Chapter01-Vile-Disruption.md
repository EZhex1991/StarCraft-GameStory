# Prologue

> The forces of the United Earth Directorate have taken control of the planet Char and enslaved the ravenous broods of the fledgling Overmind. With the Directorate's powerful Psi Disrupter negating Kerrigan's control over the remaining broods, the UED remains uncontested in ints domination of the sector.
>
> Kerrigan, having sought out a band of unlikely allies, now plans to destroy the Psi Disrupter and sever the UED's control of the Overmind.

# Vile Disruption

> Kerrigan's Fortress, on the planet Tarsonis

## Mission Briefing

> KERRIGAN:
>> Greetings, Cerebrate. By now you've realized that I've severed your connection with the Overmind and your renegade brethren. Understand, it's nothing personal. I just can't risk you falling under their influence. You're mine now. Serve me unquestioningly, and I'll let you live.

> DURAN:
>> My Queen, pardon me for interrupting, but the visitors you have been expecting have arrived.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Finally. They certainly took their time.

> RAYNOR:
>> Yeah, well none of us were in any real hurry to get here, Sarah.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Still suspicious of my motives, Jimmy?

> RAYNOR:
>> Always.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Heh. When I contacted you both on Aiur, I told you about the new Overmind and about the UED that seeks to control it. Well, the UED has done it. They've tamed the Overmind and now control most of the Zerg broods in this sector. That's why I've asked for your help.

> FENIX:
>> You want us to help you defeat the UED so that you alone will rule the Zerg!

> KERRIGAN:
>> Wrong, Fenix. I want to defeat them because if we don't, they'll clamp down on this sector, and enslave us all! You know I'm right Jim. You've studied the history of Earth, you know what the UED's agenda is. Taking control of the Zerg is only the beginning for them.

> RAYNOR:
>> Maybe... I don't know...

> DURAN:
>> My Queen, again I beg your pardon for this interruption, but we have a very serious problem!

> KERRIGAN:
>> Perfect timing... Gentlman, we'll need to finish this conversation later... continue, Duran.

> DURAN:
>> The Psi Disrupter's signal has reached us here on Tarsonis and shattered the unity of your broods! Within the past few hours, your minions have turned on each other and left their hive clusters to run out of control!

> KERRIGAN:
>> This is just what I need. Cerebrate, take the few Zerg still under my control and do what you can to stem any further damage to the hive clusters. i can't afford to have them destroyed by my own minions!

## Objectives

> - Rescue all hives from destruction

## Mission

_Rescue the first hive cluster_

> DURAN:
>> My Queen, the hive structures are not responding to the Cerebrate's commands! There is no way to reinfore your warriors!

> KERRIGAN:
>> Cerebrates, you'll have to make due with the warriors you have. Slaughter the dissident Zerg in my name!
