# Omega

> Infested platform over the planet Char  
> Kerrigan's base of operations

## Mission Briefing

> KERRIGAN:
>> Cerebrate, our scouts have just identified three separate fleets approaching this platform. With Duran having disappeared, and the bulk of my broods still on the surface of Char, you'll need to hold off the invaders by yourself.

> MENGSK:
>> You sound worried, Kerrigan. Have I caught you at a bad time?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Not at all, Arcturus. How'd you manage to scrape up your new fleet? Been raiding the salvage dump again?

> MENGSK:
>> I called in a few favors. Made a few concessions. You'd be surprised to see how many special interest groups in this sector want to see you dead.

> KERRIGAN:
>> I'm sorry to have to disappoint your new friends, Arcturus. But you really shouldn't have attempted this stunt. It'll take more than your three little fleets to bring me down.

> MENGSK:
>> Three fleets?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Don't play dumb, Arcturus. I've already spotted the other two fleets.

> ARTANIS:
>> Kerrigan, this is Artanis. My brethren and I have come to avenge the deaths of Fenix, the Matriarch, and all of the other Protoss who fell before the Swarm! It is long past time you paid for your crimes against our people.

> KERRIGAN:
>> When it rains, it pours...

> MENGSK:
>> Hah ha ha... The Protoss, too! Care to take a guess as to who the third fleet is?

> KERRIGAN:
>> No need to guess. It's DuGalle and the remainder of the UED fleet.

> DUGALLE:
>> That is correct, Kerrigan. This is Admiral DuGalle. I am giving you one last chance to surrender your forces, and submit to the sovereign authority of the United Earth Directorate.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Gee, that's a tough one, Admiral. You'll have let me think for a minute... You know, Admiral, I think I'll just massacre your remaining troops now and watch you die in agony. How would that be?

> DUGALLE:
>> You vastly underestimate me, my dear.

> KERRIGAN:
>> I don't think so, Admiral. You see, at this point... I'm pretty much the Queen Bitch of the Universe. And not all of your little soldiers or space ships will stand in my way again.

> DUGALLE:
>> So be it.

## Objectives

> - Destroy all enemy bases

## Mission

_Destroy Dominion forces (red)_

> MENGSK:
>> Congratulations, Kerrigan. You've beaten me again. Just remember that I'll be out there... Waiting for you to slip up. Because sooner or later you'll make a mistake. And when you do...

_Destroy Protoss forces (blue)_

> ARTANIS:
>> Savor this victory, Kerrigan! For the Protoss will never forget your treachery. We shall be watching you.

_Destroy UED forces (white)_

> DUGALLE:
>> Kerrigan, I am prepared to offer terms of surrender. It is my wish that you allow my men to live-

> KERRIGAN:
>> You're not in a position to offer me anything, Admiral. And I don't take prisoners. I'll tell you what... Turn your remaining ships around and start heading back towards the Earth. I'll let you have a head start, before I send the Swarms after you. It'll be interesting sport to see how far you get before you die.

# Epilogue

> Shortly after DuGalle's defeat, the remainder of the UED Fleet was overtaken by Kerrigan's forces and eradicated. No UED vessel ever made it back to Earth to report what had transpired.
>
> With his rag-tag fleet beaten and crippled, Arcturus Mengsk fled back to Korhal to lick his wounds and plan the reconstruction of his Terran Dominion...
>
> Artanis and the Protoss survivors returned to Shakuras to begin rebuilding their once glorious civilization...
>
> Zeratul and James Raynor went their separate ways and have not been heard from since their departure.
>
> And alone, floating on a dark platform above the burnt-out planet of Char, Sarah Kerrigan, the Queen of Blades, sat and lorded over the ravenous Swarms, Unable to shake the feeling that a great threat loomed just over the horizon, Kerrigan could only stare off into the vastness of space where she beheld a great void. Or perhaps a reflection of a hollow victory and of the trials yet to come...
