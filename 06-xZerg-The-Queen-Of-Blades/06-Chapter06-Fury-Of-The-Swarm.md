# Fury of the Swarm

> Kerrigan's Fortress, on the planet Tarsonis  
> Two days later

## Mission Briefing

> DURAN:
>> My Queen, our scouts have just discovered a massive wave of Zerg in high orbit. Hundreds of Zerg have landed upon Tarsonis and are even now approaching our location! A number of our outposts are already under attack by the renegade Swarm!

> KERRIGAN:
>> So, the UED is testing out their control of their pet Overmind. I had hoped to lay low after we razed Korhal, but it seems the UED is intent on forcing my hand.

> DURAN:
>> Shall I rally your forces, my Queen?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Yes. We've got to defend our remaining outposts and make sure that the renegades can't gain a foothold in our immediate vicinity. Once we've secured our perimeter, we'll begin to take the fight to their hive clusters.

## Objectives

> - Destroy the renegade Zerg

## Mission

> DURAN:
>> My Queen, we have located a small Terran facility towards the rear of the Renegade's landing zone. There appears to be a number of UED scientists working within the compound, but we are unable to determine the purpose of their presence...

> KERRIGAN:
>> I know what they're up to. I suspected that the UED's control of the Overmind was tenous. Tarsonis is too remote for them to maintain direct control over the Swarms, so they've sent these 'scientists' to coordinate their attack.

> DURAN:
>> Cerebrate, focus your attack against the Terran facility. All of the UED scientists must be killed. Only then will we be able to finish off these Renegade Zerg.

> NEW MISSION OBJECTIVES
> - Kill all the UED Scientists
