> Holding orbit over the planet Shakuras

## Mission Briefing

> KERRIGAN:
>> Cerebrate, it's time we returned to Shakuras. I have some unfinished business with the Dark Templar Matriarch, Raszagal. I'll need to steal her from her tribe before we can finally assault the Overmind on Char. However, her defenders will not simply allow us to take her away.

> DURAN:
>> The pylon clusters are generating some sort of electromagnetic field that is preventing our flyers from maneuvering. We won't have any air support at all.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Then we'll need some new strategy...

> DURAN:
>> Perhaps it would be best if we staged some kind of diversion, my Queen, and claimed the Matriarch during the confusion.

> KERRIGAN:
>> What did you have in mind, Duran?

> DURAN:
>> The Protoss outpost of Talematros is built upon a large mesa and is fueled and supported by a number of adjacent pylon clusters. I believe that if we can cause a surge within those pylon clusters, we can cause Talematro's power grids to overload. The resulting explosion will be the perfect cover for retrieving the Matriarch.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Clean, simple, devious. I like it. Make it happen Duran. Cerebrate, you'll provide cover for Duran as he infiltrates the pylon clusters. Let nothing stand in our way!

## Objectives
