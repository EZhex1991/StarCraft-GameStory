# Reign of Fire

> High orbit over the planet Braxis

## Mission Briefing

> KERRIGAN:
>> The Psi Disrupter is causing me some very serious problems. Although I've regained control of my forces here, it's taking more and more concentration just to keep them in line.

> RAYNOR:
>> Aww... My heart's breaking for you, Kerrigan. Now exactly why was it that you asked Fenix and I to bring Mengsk to you?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Are you still suspicious that I'll kill him for abandoning me to the Zerg? I've gotten over it, Jim. We can't afford to let petty hatreds jeopardize our plans for the UED.

> MENGSK:
>> That's reassuring.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Arcturus... I presume you found your cold-sleep chamber... accommodating?

> MENGSK:
>> What is the meaning of this, Kerrigan?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Straight to the point, huh? I was hoping to chat. It's been awhile.

> MENGSK:
>> Not long enough. Why have I been brought here?

> KERRIGAN:
>> I need your Psi Emmiters, Arcturus.

> MENGSK:
>> Why?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Remember the Confederate Psi Disrupter that you could never find? Well, the UED found it. And it's preventing me from controlling my minions. With the help of your Psi Emmiters, I can gather up enough Zerg to destroy the Disrupter and confront the UED.

> MENGSK:
>> And what are you offering me in return?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Hah. Ever the politician. All right, 'Emperor', if you help me destroy the Disrupter, I'll help you retake Korhal from the UED.

> MENGSK:
>> Hmm... a tempting offer. What assurances do I have of you fulfilling your end of the bargain?

> KERRIGAN:
>> The only thing I can assure you of, Arcturus, is that without my help, you'll be the Emperor of your own little eight by eight cell for the rest of your life.

> MENGSK:
>> I see that you're still a persuasive speaker. All right, Kerrigan. I'll lend you some Emitters, but this had better be worth it.

## Objectives

> - Destroy the Psi Disrupter

## Mission

> RAYNOR:
>> All right boys and girls, listen up! Our objective is to locate and disable the Psi Disrupter's primary power generator. Once we've done that, we'll turn the mission over the Mengsk and Kerrigan. Let's move out!

> GHOST:
>> I'm gone...

> MARINE:
>> Go! Go! Go!

> RAYNOR:
>> Kerrigan, the generator's off-line. You can send down the Psi Emitters at any time.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Good work, Jim.

> MENGSK:
>> The Psi Emitter will be carried by one of my SCV's. With the Disrupter's power cut, the Emitter should be able to get the attention of any renegade Zerg near it. The SCV will then be able to lure the Zerg back to your base. Once the Zerg arrive there, you'll be able to assert direct control cover them.

_Acquire at least 1 Zerg Drone using the Psi Emitter_

> KERRIGAN:
>> Perfect! With these Zerg I can construct a new hive cluster! Once my forces have grown strong enough, I can assault the Psi Disrupter directly!

_Acquire Hunter Killer / Devouring One / Torrasque_

> KERRIGAN:
>> Excellent work! Although these Zerg are now under my control, I sense that there are more Zerg out there. We must lure as many of them here as possible!

_Have acquired all remaining scattered renegade Zerg_

> SCV:
>> Um, with all due respect to Miss Kerrigan sir. These critters make me nervous as hell. I sure would appreciate some immediate evac.
