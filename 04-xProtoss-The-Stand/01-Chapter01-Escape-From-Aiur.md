# Escape From Aiur

Isolated Protoss base on the planet Aiur

## Mission Briefing

> ALDARIS:
>> Greetings, Executor. Though we all grieve for the loss of mighty Tassadar, we must find the resolve to carry on. He sacrified himself to destroy the Overmind, but many Zerg still rage across our ruined homeworld. Without the Conclave to lead us, or the protection of our great fleets, it seems we must fend for ourselves.

> ZERATUL:
>> Aldaris is correct, Executor. As we have both seen, the Zerg will not halt their rampage until every last one of us is dead. I suggest that we retreat to our last functional warp gate and travel to where the Zerg cannot follow us.

> ALDARIS:
>> With all due respect, Zeratul, the Protoss do not run from their enemies. Aiur is our homeworld. It is here that we shall make our stand!

> ZERATUL:
>> Just as your Conclave did? They are dead now, Aldaris, dead because they allowed their pride to blind their reason. Only if we learn from their mistake can we live to avenge them. Now, Executor, I know of a place where we can find solace. It is Shakuras, the secret homeworld of my people the Dark Templar.

> ALDARIS:
>> Your people? We would be seen as tyrants to them! Why would they shelter us?

> ZERATUL:
>> Have I not pledged myself to your cause? Not all beings are as unforgiving as your lamented Conclave, Aldaris.

> ALDARIS:
>> You are right, of course. Executor, Zeratul shall find us passage to the warp gate. After the gate has been secured, Fenix and the new Praetor Artanis shall lead our surviving brethren to Shakuras.

> ARTANIS:
>> Executor, I am Artanis. Though I have only recently been appointed Praetor, you can trust that I will uphold the honor and traditions of the Templar.

> ALDARIS:
>> We shall see.

> RAYNOR:
>> Hey, boys, mind if we tag along? I figure headin' anywhere's got to be better than stayin' here with the Zerg!

> ZERATUL:
>> Commander Raynor. As ever, your assistance is appreciated. We would be honored if you joined us.

## Objectives

- Bring Zeratul to the warp gate
- Zeratul must survive

## Mission

_Spot the first Zerg Nydus Cannal_

> ZERATUL:
>> We should destroy these Nydus Cannals so as to stem the flow of the Zerg reinforcements through them.

_Near the bottom left corner of the screen_

> ZEALOT:
>> En Taro Adun! There is not time to waste. We must join our brethren in battle.

_Acquire more reinforcements near Ultralisk area_

> ZERATUL:
>> Ah, it is good to see more of our brethren on the battlefield.

_Final reinforcement area (near upper right screen corner)_

> TEMPLAR:
>> En Taro Adun, Zeratul! This is all that remains of our forces in this province. We have found the location of the warp gate, but there is a sizeable Zerg force blocking the way.

_Reach the warp gate_

> ZERATUL:
>> Executor, I have located the warp gate. We must hurry and evacuate the Khalai survivors before the Zerg return!

> RAYNOR:
>> Just worry about getting your people through the gate, Executor. Fenix and I will hang back and protect our flank until everyone is through.
