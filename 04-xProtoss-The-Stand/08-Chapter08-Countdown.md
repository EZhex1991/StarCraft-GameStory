# Countdown

> Main Protoss base, the planet Shakuras

## Mission Briefing

> ARTANIS:
>> This entire chain of events has been masterminded by Kerrigan, and we played right into her hands!

> ZERATUL:
>> Yes we did, Artanis. Yet our course is set nonetheless. Using the Temple's energies against the renegade Zerg may accomplish Kerrigan's aims, but it is still our only chance of sruvival.

> RASZAGAL:
>> And survive we will, my warriors. For too long have we labored in futile defense as our enemies push us further and further away from victory. The time has come to let loose the full fury of our powers! Never again shall Shakuras be despoiled by the foul touch of alien species! These Zerg shall be the first to fall before us!

> ZERATUL:
>> Matriarch, I have served you for many millennia. I have always valued your wisdom and strength. Yet lately, in your mind, I have sensed something that clouds your true spirit. Though Kerrigan has gone, I wonder if her treachery still remains?

> RASZAGAL:
>> Be at ease, Zeratul. I am still the same Raszagal you have always known. These recent events have weighed heavily upon me and I am wearied. But fear not; my warrior spirit will shine before you, and light your path to victory.

> ZERATUL:
>> Indeed.

> ARTANIS:
>> The time for action is upon us! The crystals must be taken to the Temple while the Zerg still muster their forces. I shall carry the Uraj myself, while Zeratul handles the Khalis.

> RASZAGAL:
>> Executor, you shall provide escort of Artanis and Zeratul as they make their way to the Temple. Gods willing, we will channel the energies of the Xel'Naga, and scour this world clean of the Zerg! Go now, my children, and know that the survival of our entire race depends upon your actions!
