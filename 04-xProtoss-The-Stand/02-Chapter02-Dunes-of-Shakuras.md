# Dunes of Shakuras

> Protoss base camp on the planet Shakuras

## Mission Briefing

> ARTANIS:
>> En Taro Tassadar, Executor. The survivors from Aiur have made it safely through the gate. Yet, amidst the chaos of our retreat we lost contact with Fenix and Raynor. I fear that they may have been overrun by the Zerg.

> ZERATUL:
>> Fear not, Artanis. Fenix is as stalwart a warrior as I have ever known, and the Terran Raynor has proven himself to be highly resourceful in the past. I for one believe that they made it here safely. But while we wait for word from them, we must reconnoiter the surrounding area and find a suitable location for a more permanet settlement. Once we're situated we can begin to search for the Dark Templar.

## Objectives

> - Establish a base and find the Dark Templar

## Mission

_Spot Zerglings at the beginning_

> ARTANIS:
>> Executor! There are Zerg on Shakuras! They must have taken control of the warp gate on Aiur!

_Build a Nexus, get attacked by Hydralisks, then the Dark Ones show up_

> DARK TEMPLAR:
>> Neraz Gulio.
>>
>> Ner'mah!
>>
>> Zerashk gulida!
>>
>> Adun Toridas, Zeratul! Glad I am to see that you've returned home after these many decades. But the strange guests that have followed you here seem ill-tempered.

> ZERATUL:
>> Well met, my brother! Indeed, these creatures known as the Zerg have no regard for the sanctity of life. Once we have secured this area, I shall tell you everything I know about them in council.

> DARK TEMPLAR:
>> I am sure the Matriarch will be eager to hear your tale as well.

> ARTANIS:
>> Executor! We have received a transmission from Raynor and Fenix! They are still alive, and are fighting to retake the wrap gate on Aiur! We must secure the gate on this side without delay!

> NEW MISSION OBJECTIVE:  
> -Destroy the Zerg base

_Find the Warp Gate_

> ARTANIS:
>> There is no sign of Fenix or Raynor. They must still be on Aiur!

_Destroy the Zerg base_

> RAYNOR:
>> Executor, my crew and I will remain here on Aiur and shut the gate down on this side. It's the only way to make sure the Zerg won't send more reinforcements to Shakuras.

> ARTANIS:
>> You will be hopelessly outnumbered, and once the gate is shut down there will be no one to save you should you be overrun.

> RAYNOR:
>> Yeah, well... I'm a man of action. What can I say?

> FENIX:
>> I shall remain with Raynor as well, Executor. My duty is to Aiur, after all.

> ARTANIS:
>> Farewell then, brave warriors. We will send through all the troops we can spare.

> RAYNOR:
>> Thanks. You kids just remember to play nice from now on, ok? Wish us luck.
