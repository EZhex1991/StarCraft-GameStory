# The Battle of Braxis

Protoss fleet, high orbit over the planet Braxis

## Mission Briefing

> ARTANIS:
>> Executor! Our sensors have just identified a large group of Terran vessels. However, their configuration profile is unlike any Terran group yet encountered. We are receiving a transmission from the fleet's command ship, identifying itself as the Aleksander.

> STUKOV:
>> Protoss Commander, I am Admiral Alexei Stukov of the United Earth Directorate. We are here to take control of the Terran Doominion and all of its outlying colonies. You are in direct violation of Terran space and have openly attacked Terran troops. Lower your shields and power down your weapon systems. The UED will be taking custody of your ships and whatever spoils you have garnered from this planet.

> ZERATUL:
>> United Earth Directorate? Raynor spoke of the distant Terran homeworld called Earth. These humans have come a long way to make war on us.

> ARTANIS:
>> Have faith, Zeratul! You almost sound as if you fear these humans. What are they to such as we? Was it not we who defeated the dreaded Overmind?

> ZERATUL:
>> Yes, Artanis. We did vanquish the Overmind. But we did so with the help of humans. Do not be so quick to underestimate them.

> ARTANIS:
>> Of course. Executor, I shall test the mettle of these humans by scouting ahead of your ships, and finding a way through this blockade!
>>
>> En Taro Tassadar!

>> Reinforcements are on route now, young templar.
