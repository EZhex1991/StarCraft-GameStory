# The Insurgent

> Executor's Citadel at New Antioch, Shakuras

## Mission Briefing

> RASZAGAL:
>> Congratulations, Executor. Your success has brought us the promise of hope against the Zerg. However, we face a new threat within our own ranks. In your absence, Judicator Aldaris and an entire legion of Khalai survivors from Aiur have begun an open revolt against us.

> ZERATUL:
>> By the gods, this is ill news indeed! Why would Aldaris betray us so?

> RASZAGAL:
>> He and his ilk believe that it was wrong to have abandoned Aiur and consorted with our people. Their prejudices have driven them to perpetuate the Conclave's sins against us! Even now, Aldaris and his loyalist templar forces are preparing to attack our Citadel.

> ARTANIS:
>> I can scarcely believe this. As if the Zerg were not enough! Matriarch, are you certain of this?

> RASZAGAL:
>> All too certain, young templar. Executor, as Matriarch of the Dark Templar and custodian of this world, I hereby order you to terminate Judicator Aldaris, and quell this untimely uprising without delay! There will be no dissent among us while the Zerg are poised to strike!

> ZERATUL:
>> There is something amiss here. The Matriarch has always been a wise and gentle soul. Though there is some merit in her decision, this is very unlike her.

> ARTANIS:
>> That may well be... But right now we have a friend to kill. May Adun forgive us.

## Objectives

> - Kill the traitor Aldaris

## Mission

> ARTANIS:
>> Be advised, Executor, our forces are divided. Aldaris has taken control of our templar warriors and Arbiters. It is possible that he may even send Archons against us.

> ZERATUL:
>> Fear not, comrades, for we have Archons of our own! Should the dire need arise, all Dark Templar may merge to become Dark Archons. Though we sacrifice our warriors in doing so, only the might of the Dark Archons can match the forces of Aldaris.

_Kill Aldaris' phantom_

> ALDARIS:
>> You didn't think I'd be caught so easily did you, Executor? You have only destroyed a phantom.

_Kill another phantom_

> ALDARIS:
>> Yet again, Executor, you destroy only a simulacrum of myself! You believe me to be a traitor, but it is you and the Matriarch who will usher our race to oblivion!

_Kill the real Aldaris_

> ZERATUL:
>> It is finished, Judicator. Surrender your remaining forces, and join us in eradicating the Zerg.

> ALDARIS:
>> I would sooner die, dark one, than tarnish the memory of Aiur by joining with you. Your fate was sealed the moment you Matriarch allied herself with the Queen of Blades! Those of us still loyal to Aiur will never be slaves to Kerrigan and her Broods.

> ARTANIS:
>> Aldaris, be reasonable! Kerrigan has changed. She no longer seeks to enslave everyone. Do not force us to destroy you.

> ALDARIS:
>> You can no longer afford to be so naive, Artanis. While you were securing the crystals, I discovered that your Matriarch has been harboring dark secret! She has been manipulated by de-

> KERRIGAN:
>> We have no time for this!

> ZERATUL:
>> Kerrigan.. What have you done?

> KERRIGAN:
>> I just cleaned up your mess, Protoss. Don't be so squeamish.

> ZERATUL:
>> Wretched creature! This was a Protoss matter; you had no right to interfere! Begone from this world! You are no longer welcome among us!

> KERRIGAN:
>> Fine. I've done what I came herre to do. I've insured the destruction of the renegade Cerebrates, and I used you to do it. Have fun, might protoss... We'll be seeing each other again, real soon...
