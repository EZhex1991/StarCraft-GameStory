> Low orbit over the planet Aiur

## Mission Briefing

> TASSADAR:
>> En Taro Adun Executor! My gratitude to you, for having secured my release, knows no bounds. By all the gods, we may win yet! The time has com to let loose the fury of the Dark Templar. Zeratul, perhaps the time has come to tell our friends of the foe we face.

> ZERATUL:
>> Indeed. When I slew the Cerebrate on Char, I touched briefly with the essence of the Overmind. In that instant, my mind was filled with its thoughts, and I tell you now our worst fears have come true.
>>
>> The Zerg were indeed created by the ancient Xel'Naga, the same beings that empowered us in our infacy. But the Overmind grew beyond their constraints, and has at last come to finish the experiments they began so long ago.

> TASSADAR:
>> So you see my friends, we fight not only to save Aiur, but all creation! If we fall to the Zerg then the Overmind will run rampant throughout the stars, consuming all sentience - all life. It is up to us to put an end to this madness, once and for all.

> FENIX:
>> Our forces shall engage the primary Zerg Hive clusters in an attempt to weaken their defenses. Once their numbers have thinned out, Zeratul and his companions can infiltrate the clusters and assassinate the Cerebrates. Adun willing, the Cerebrates' deaths will distract the Overmind long enough for us to assault it directly.

## Objectives

> - Use Zeratul to destroy the Zerg Cerebrates
> - Zeratul and Fenix must survive
