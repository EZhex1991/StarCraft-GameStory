# Prologue

> Tassadar was taken into Judicator custody and sentenced to stand trial for his crimes against the Conclave. Fenix, Raynor and Tassadar's followers escaped from the Conclave's agents, as the Dark Templar slipped away in the chaos.

# The Trial of Tassadar

> Protoss Command Ship Gantrithor  
> Holding Orbit over the planet Aiur

## Mission Briefing

> FENIX:
>> En Taro Adun, Executor. All seems lost now, but still we must fight on. We must find Tassadar and secure his release from the Judicator before they can execute him for treason. Without him, I fear there is no way to defeat the Zerg and their Overmind.
>>
>> Zeratul and his Dark Templar have vanished, leaving us to fend for ourselves. I wonder if Tassadar was mistaken to have put his trust in them. We are receiving a transmission from Captain Raynor's command ship.

> RAYNOR
>> This is Raynor. I'd like to help if I can. Tassadar laid it on the line for me and my crew on Char. I'd like to repay the debt. Besides, I'm a long way from home, surrounded by hostile aliens. I've got to do something.

> FENIX:
>> Than you shall, bold human. You shall.

## Objectives

> - Destroy the Stasis Cell
> - Fenix and Raynor must survive

## Mission

> TIP:  
> Carriers cannot attack without interceptors. To build additional interceptors select the Carrier and click "Build Interceptor".

_Reach the stasis Cell perimeter_

> FENIX:
>> Executor, we have found Tassadar's Stasis Cell. We will attempt to free him now.

_Destroy the Stasis Cell_

> ALDARIS:
>> I expected you to attempt to retrieve your hero. You will learn that the will of the Conclave is absolute. Make peace with Adun.

> ZERATUL:
>> Stay thy hand, Judicator. The stewards of Tassadar shall not fall while the Dark Templar live. Call off your guards and stand aside, and you may yet live to see another moonrise.

> ALDARIS:
>> I will not be addressed so by one so devoid of the Khala's light. You and your vile brethren shall die with these traitors.

> ZERATUL:
>> Are you truly so blinded by your vaunted religion, that you can't see the fall ahead of you? Your Conclave believes that they are winning this war, but all they've succeeded in doing is helping the Overmind to win.

> ALDARIS:
>> What could you possibly know about our designs, blasphemer?

> ZERATUL:
>> You speak of knowledge, Judicator? You speak of experience? I have journeyed through the darkness between the most distant stars. I have beheld the births of negative-suns and borne witness to the entropy of entire realities...
>>
>> Unto my experience, Aldaris, all that you've built here on Aiur is but a fleeting dream. A dream from which your precious Conclave shall awaken, finding themselves drowned in a greater nightmare.

> ALDARIS:
>> We shall see...
