# Prologue

> The Zerg Hive cluster near the Scion province was destroyed, but the Protoss forces paid a high price for their victory.
>
> Praetor Fenix, hero and Steward of the Templar, was killed during the assault. The Conclave, convinced that its strategems are winning the war against the Zerg, have let down their guard and turn their attention to personal matters. The Judicator Aldaris was ordered to find and arrest the wayward Tassadar and bring him home to stand trial for his crimes of treason.
>
> Now, with only a small fleet of protection, Aldaris and the Executor have traveled to the ash world of Char, hoping that Tassadar is still somewhere to be found.

# The Hunt for Tassadar

> Protoss Command Ship Gantrithor  
> Holding orbit over the planet Char

## Mission Briefing

> ALDARIS:
>> Executor, I know that you were reluctant to leave Aiur in this dark hour, and that you still grieve for the lost of your comrade, Fenix. But remember that he lived and died as a Templar. He has reached the Khala's end. There is no greater glory than that.
>>
>> We Judicator are called to look beyond such matters; to ensure the safety and future of our people. It is not the Zerg, but the rouge Tassadar, who represents the greatest threat to us now.
>>
>> If he is allowed to spread the Dark Templar's tainted influence to Aiur, all will be lost. We will find him and bring him to judgement.
>>
>> Tassadar claimed that this world was abandoned by the Zerg just prior to the invasion of Aiur. Yet, I still sense a lingering darkness here. Be prepared for anything, Executor. If there are still Zerg on this world, then they must surely know of our arrival.

## Objectives

> - Find Tassadar
> - Bring Tassadar to the beacon

## Mission

_Bring unit to Tassadar location_

> TASSADAR:
>> Aldaris? Executor? How is that you've come here? I was about to abandon all hope of rescue!

> ALDARIS:
>> I have come to arrest you and bring you home to Aiur to stand trial.

> TASSADAR:
>> Arrest me? Aiur burns at the touch of the Zerg, and you travel all this way to arrest me?

> RAYNOR:
>> Don't let it get to you, man. This happened to me once...

> ALDARIS:
>> Who is this human, Tassadar?

> RAYNOR:
>> The name's Jim Raynor, pal. And I won't be talked down to by anybody. Not even a Protoss.

> ALDARIS:
>> Amusing... Tassadar, your taste in companions grows ever more inexplicable. Executor, prepare to take Tassadar into custody.

> TASSADAR:
>> Executor, wait. I do not know what they have told you about me, but what I've done, I've done for Aiur. Help me find Zeratul and his Dark Templar. They alone can defeat the Overmind's Cerebrates. Once we've won I'll gladly submit myself to the judgement of the Conclave.

> ALDARIS:
>> Unthinkable! You presume that we would side with the Dark Ones as you have? You have gone quite mad, Tassadar.

> TASSADAR:
>> You shall speak of them with respect, Aldaris. Executor, there is much that I can explain to you, if only you'll help me find Zeratul.

> NEW MISSION OBJECTIVES:  
> -Bring Tassadar and Raynor to the Beacon

> HIGH TEMPLAR:
>> We've been surrounded!

_Bring Tassadar and Raynor to the beacon_

> TASSADAR:
>> You have my thanks, Executor. Now let's find Zeratul and speed our way home.
