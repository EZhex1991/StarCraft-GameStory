> TASSADAR:
>> Greetings, Dark One. I have come to bring you home.

> ZERATUL:
>> Greetings to you mighty Tassadar. I knew that you would not forsake us. For in the time that you have spent with us, you have learned to value our ways and our methods. You have learned to channel our dark power as well as that of your masters; thus of the Khala. But I fear that the Conclave, in it's pride, could never bring itself to welcome outcasts such as we.

> TASSADAR:
>> Outcasts though you may be, it is your vision and courage that may yet save our Homeworld from the Swarm. I beg of you, Zeratul, return with us to Aiur. Though they are petty, and have, in ignorance cursed your kind for generations... help me save our people.

> ZERATUL:
>> Since our banishment long ago, we have never failed in our responsibility to Aiur. Though it shall cause us great pain to see our homeland once more, we shall return with you, Tassadar. We will do what we can.
