# Prologue

> The Zerg Overmind has succeeded in invading the Protoss Homeworld of Aiur and has embedded itself into the crust of the planet.
>
> Now, as the agents of the sinister Overmind spread chaos and destruction across the face of Aiur, the stalwart Protoss defenders prepare themselves for the coming onslaught.

# First Strike

> Citadle of the new Protoss Executor  
> Two days after the Zerg invasion

## Mission Briefing

> ALDARIS:
>> Entaro Adun, Executor. I am Judicator Aldaris, and I have been sent by the Conclave to serve and counsel you. The former Executor, Tassadar, was commanded to halt the Zerg Progress in the Terran sector by burning the infested human worlds.
>>
>> Unfortunately, he disregarded his orders and attempted to destroy the Zerg while sparing the Terrans from the flame. Clearly, Tassadar has failed us. You must not.
>>
>> The Conclave has dictated that our first priority is to strengthen our defenses. You must reinforce our outpost in Antioch and make certain that the province does not fall to the Zerg. Your old comrade, Praetor Fenix, will meet you there and assist you in this endeavor.

## Objectives

> - Meet Fenix at Antioch
> - Destroy the Zerg base
> - Fenix must survive

## Mission

_Bring unit to Antioch base_

> FENIX:
>> Ah, Executor! En Taro Adun! It is good to see you once more upon the field of battle.
>>
>> Alas, all of our Probes were lost in the last Zerg attack, and we had no resources with which to replace them.

> NOTE:  
> Robotic Probes - which are used to warp in buildings and gather resources - can be built at a Nexus.

_Build 1 Probe_

> Fenix:
>> I had intended to construct Photon Cannons here for defense, but without Probes, we could not do so.

> NOTE:  
> Protoss buildings can only be placed within the blue area of influence of a Pylon.

_Warping in a building_

> NOTE:  
> After it has started a building's warp rift, a Probe can be given new commands. The building will finish warping in on its own.

_Destroying the Zerg base_

> FENIX:
>> You know, Executor, although we two have marched across hundreds of worlds together, I never imagined that we would be fighting on Aiur. The Zerg are indeed worthy foes.
