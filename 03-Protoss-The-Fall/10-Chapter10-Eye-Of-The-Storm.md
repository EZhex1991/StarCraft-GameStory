# Eye of the Storm

> Protoss Command Ship Gantrithor  
> Low orbit over the planet Aiur

## Mission Briefing

> FENIX:
>> Executor, our plan worked perfectly. The Zerg defenses are broken, and the way to the Overmind is laid bare! The time for our stand has come.

> TASSADAR:
>> Indeed. My friends, this is our final hour. Not all of us may survive the coming conflict. Yet, death may be a blessing should we fail here. We seek now to destroy a foe that has ravaged its way across the universe consuming all in its path.
>>
>> And nwo it has reached the end of its long journey. The Overmind has come to destroy all that we hold dear and assimilate us into itself. And I say to thee, this shall not come to pass! Aiur shall not fall! Exeutor, I stand ready!

> ZERATUL:
>> As do I.

> RAYNOR:
>> Well, I guess all I have left is to see this through. The Zerg have taken everything from me: My home, my family, my friends. I know that nothing I do can bring those things back, but I'll be damned if I just sit on my hands and wait for the end. I want a piece of 'em, all right, I'm in.

> TASSADAR:
>> Then let our actions speak for us! For Adun! For Aiur!

## Objectives

> - Destroy the Overmind
> - Tassadar, Raynor, and Zeratul must survive

## Mission

> ALDARIS:
>> Executor. Tassadar. This comes too late to you. But the Conclave has witnessed your defeat of the Cerebrate. They know now that they cannot deny the necessity or the valiancy of your actions. We sought to punish you, while it was we who were in error. You represent the greatest in us all, and our hopes go with you. EN TARO ADUN, brave Sons of Aiur!

> RAYNOR:
>> Wow. Does that mean they're goin' to send some back-up for us?

_Successfully destroy the Overmind (its outer shell only though...)_

> TASSADAR:
>> Executor, the Overmind has been weakened, but I fear we have sustained severe damage ourselves. I will steer the Gantrithor into a collision course with the Overmind. If I can channel enough of the Dark Templar's energy through the hull of the Gantrithor, I should be able to bring swift death to the accursed abomination. Remember us, Executor. Remember what was down here today. May Adun watch over you.

# Epilogue

> As the chaotic, swirling energies subsided, a heavy silence settled over the battlefields of Aiur. Due to Tassadar's noble sacrifice, the Overmind was now dead and the Zerg Swarms were scattered and broken. But as the heroes surveyed their once glories homeland, they realized that their victory has cost them all but their lives. Aiur was left nothing more than a smoldering ruin. Those few Protoss who survived the final battle could only wonder what the future would hold for their race.
