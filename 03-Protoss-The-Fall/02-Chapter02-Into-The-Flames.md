# Into the Flames

> Citadel of the Executor  
> The following night

## Mission Briefing

> ALDARIS:
>> En Taro Adun, Executor. Your defense of Antioch has restored my faith in the Templar caste. I admit that Tassadar's desertion had shaken my faith.

> TASSADAR:
>> Indeed, Aldaris? I would hope that the judicator would put more faith in their Templar brethren.

> ALDARIS:
>> Tassadar! Where have you been?

> TASSADAR:
>> Be silent, Judicator. There is no time to waste, and I have much to tell you. As you know, the Zerg vanished after the fall of the Terran world of Tarsonis, and though the Conclave bid me return home, I was compelled to remain.
>>
>> A powerful psionic call drew my attention to a remote, barren world named Char. Apparently, the call was answered by others as well. For upon Char, I encountered those who were once our brethren - the Dark Templar.

> ALDARIS:
>> Consorting with the Fallen Ones is heresy!

> TASSADAR:
>> Enough! Hear me, Executor, for I have learned much from the Dark Templar Prelate, Zeratul.
>>
>> The Overmind controls its minions through agents called Cerebrates. Strike down the Cerebrates, and the Swarms will surely fall.

> FINIX:
>> Executor, Tarssadar may be right. If you can keep the Zerg occupied, my force may be able to penetrate their perimeter and slay the abomination.

> ALDARIS:
>> I pray we can trust you, Tassadar. Already I can sense the taint of the Fallen One's influence on your mind. You must return to Aiur at once!

> TASSADAR:
>> My concern is for the safety of Aiur, not the judgements of the Conclave. I will return when the time is right.
