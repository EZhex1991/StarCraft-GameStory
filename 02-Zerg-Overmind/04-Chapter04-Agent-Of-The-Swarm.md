# Agent of the Swarm

> Primary Hive Cluster  
> Planet Char

## Mission Briefing

> ZASZ:
>> Cerebrate, be warned. While Daggoth is occupied with the forces of the Dominion, the emanations of the Chrysalis have called even more of our enemies to Char!

> OVERMIND:
>> These too shall be eradicated by your hand, Cerebrate, for you grow more cunning with each passing battle. Indeed, you are a testment to my will and the fury of the Swarm.
>>
>> Yet first must you stay your wrath, and watch over the Chrysalis a while longer. For the very hour of the sleeper's rebirth is at hand, and soon my greatest creation shall be loosed.

## Objectives

> - Protect the Chrysalis until it is ready to hatch

## Mission

> RAYNOR:
>> All right. All crews, stay frosty, and keep your eyes peeled for our target. Remember, not only are we up against the Zerg here, but our old pal General Duke may be creepin' around too. Let's hope this trip wasn't a big mistake...

_30 Seconds to Chrysalis hatching_

> ZASZ:
>> Cerebrate! The chrysalis is opening! Do not allow any Terrans near it!

_Chrysalis hatching_

> OVERMIND:
>> Arise, my daughter. Arise... Kerrigan.

> KERRIGAN:
>> By your will, father, I live to serve... Let all who oppose the Overmind feel the wrath of the Swarm.

> OVERMIND:
>> Well done, Cerebrate! What I have wrought this day shall be the undoing of my enemies! Let not a Terran survive...

> RAYNOR:
>> Mother of God... Kerrigan, what have they done to you?

> NEW MISSION OBJECTIVES:  
> -Infest or destroy Raynor's Command Center  
> -Kerrigan must survive

_Destroy or infest Raynor's Command Center_

> RAYNOR:
>> Sarah... Is that really you?

> KERRIGAN:
>> To an extent... I'm far more than I once was, Jim. You shouldn't have come here.

> RAYNOR:
>> But the dreams... I dreamed you were still alive... that somehow... you were calling to me.

> KERRIGAN:
>> I was. While I was in the Chrysalis. I instinctively reached out to you and Arcturus telepathically. Apparently, Arcturus sent Duke here to reclaim me. But that was then, Jim. I'm one of the Zerg, now. And I like what I am. You can't imagine how this feels...

> RAYNOR:
>> So what? Are you goin' to kill me now, darlin'?

> KERRIGAN:
>> It is certainly within my power. But you're not a threat to me, Jim. Be smart. Leave here now, and never seek to confront the Zerg again.

> RAYNOR:
>> Doesn't look like I have much choice.
