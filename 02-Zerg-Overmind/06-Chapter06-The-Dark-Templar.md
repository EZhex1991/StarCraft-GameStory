# The Dark Templar

> Primary Hive Cluster  
> Planet Char

## Mission Briefing

> KERRIGAN:
>> Do you feel that, Cerebrate? The Protoss are here. On Char. They have been for some time...
>>
>> Hiding...
>>
>> Protoss commander, it was folly of you to come here. For I am Kerrigan, and I am Queen of the Zerg!

> TASSADAR:
>> I know of you well, O Queen of the Zerg, for we have met before. I am Tassadar, of the Templar. I remember your selfless exploits, defending humanity from the Zerg. Unfortunate it is, to see that one who was once so honorable and full of life would succumb to the twisted wiles of the Overmind.

> KERRIGAN:
>> Do not presume to judge me, Templar. You'll find my powers to be more than a match for yours. In fact, I sense that your vaunted power has diminished since last we met.

> TASSADAR:
>> Mayhap, O Queen. Or it is only that I need not flaunt my power in such an infantile test of will?

> KERRIGAN:
>> Foolish Templar. Prepare your defenses! I will come for you woon.

## Objectives

> - Exterminate the Protoss intruders
> - Kerrigan must survive

## Mission

> ZASZ:
>> Kerrigan, I sense something strange about this Templar. Perhaps you should reconsider your attack.

> KERRIGAN:
>> For the last time Zasz, you question my motives and authority at your own peril.

> ZASZ:
>> You dare threaten a Cerebrate? You will be the doom of us all!

_After destroying the Protoss base_

> KERRIGAN:
>> Where are you Tassadar? Do your underlings always do your fighting for you?

> TASSADAR:
>> This shall be our battleground, O Queen. Face me here, and I will defeat you myself.

> NEW MISSION OBJECTIVES:  
> -Bring Kerrigan to Tassadar's challenge, alone

_Bring Kerrigan to the battleground and defeat him_

> KERRIGAN:
>> An illusion? Are you afraid to face me, Templar?

> TASSADAR:
>> So long as you continue to be so predictable, O Queen, I need not face you at all. You are your own worst enemy.
