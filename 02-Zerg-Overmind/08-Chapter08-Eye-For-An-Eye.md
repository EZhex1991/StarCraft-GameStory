## Mission Briefing

OVERMIND:

> Behold, my long silence is now broken, and I am made whole once more. The cunning Protoss have dared strike down that which was immortal. For the Protoss who murdered Zasz are unlike anything we have faced before. These Dark Templar radiate energies that are much like my own, and it is by these energies that they have caused me harm.
>
> Yet shall their overweening pride be their downfall. For when the assassin Zeratul murdered Zasz, his mind touched with mine, and all his secrets were made known to me. I have taken from his mind the secret location of Aiur, the Protoss Homeworld.
>
> At long last, my children, our searching is done. Soon we shall assault Aiur directly.

DAGGOTH:

> For now we must ensure that the Dark Templar can cause no more harm. Cerebrate, you shall set a trap for our foes. Kerrigan will lead them to you.

## Objectives

- Destroy the Protoss bases
- Let no Dark Templar escape
- Kerrigan must survive

## Mission

TIP:  
You can move ground forces between colonies quickly using the Nydus Canal.

_Destroying one Protoss base_

KERRIGAN:

> Once again, I grow tired of slaughtering your servants. Have the mighty Templar lost their infallible courage?

ZERATUL:

> Well spoken, Concubine of the Zerg. But though we strike at you from the shadows, do not think that we lack the courage to stand in the light. You would do well to abandon this attack.

KERRIGAN:

> You seem overconfident of your abilities, dark one. I am no helpless Cerebrate to be assailed under cover of darkness. I am the Queen of Blades, and my stare alone would reduce you to ashes. You and your ilk cease to amuse me. Prepare yourself for oblivion's embrace.

_Destroying all Protoss base_

KERRIGAN:

> Now, Protoss, you shall know my wrath. Now you will know the fury of the Queen of Blades!
