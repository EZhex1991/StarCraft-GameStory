# Among the Ruins

> The Swarms have crushed the meager human resistance and laid waste to nine of the thirteen Terran worlds. Shortly after the fall of the Terran capitol world of Tarsonis, the main Protoss fleet abandoned the Terran Sector. Now, efforts continue on Tarsonis to weed out the remaining Protoss forces.

## Mission Briefing

OVERMIND:

> Awaken my child, and embrace the glory that is your birthright. Know that I am the Overmind; the eternal will of the Swarm, and that you have been created to serve me.

> Behold that I shall set you amongst the greatest of my Cerebrates, that you might benefit from their wisdom and experience. Yet your purpose is unique. While they carry forth my will to the innumerable Broods, you have but one charge entrusted to your care.

> For I have found a creature that may Yet become the greatest of my agents. Even now it resides within a protective Chrysalis, awaiting its rebirth into the Swarm.

> You must watch over the Chrysalis, and ensure that no harm comes to the creature within it. Go now and keep safe my prize.

## Objectives

- Create a Spawning Pool
- Create a Hydralisk Den
- Protect the Chrysalis

## Mission

_Beginning of the mission_

DAGGOTH:

> The Hatchery is the heart of any Zerg colony. It spontaneously generates larva, which in turn are used to spawn your various warriors and minions.

DAGGOTH:

> Now, create a Drone and start gathering resources.

TIP:

> Using the Select Larva button on the Hatchery can make it easier to select the larvae.

_After food limit reach 9 (max)_

DAGGOTH:

> Overlords provide control for your minions. As your forces grow in number, you must hatch more Overlords to control them.

_Accumulate at least 100 ore (and current food limit is 9)_

DAGGOTH:

> You have enough minerals. Select a larva and mutate it into an Overload.

_After creating more Overlord_

DAGGOTH:

> To create new warrior strains, you must generate the various hive structures.

DAGGOTH:

> The Drones themselves mutate into these structures. Yet be careful. Never use your last Drone to make a building.

_Accumulate at least 200 ore_

DAGGOTH:

> Now, order your Drone to become a Spawning Pool.

DAGGOTH:

> You'll notice that structures can only implant themselves upon the creep.

DAGGOTH:

> You can make Creep Colonies to extend the creep, but only a Hatchery can be built upon open ground.

_After building a Spawning Pool_

ZASZ:

> Greetings, I am Zasz. I too am a Cerebrate of the Overmind. I have located a small band of terrans who could threaten the chrysalis and the hive cluster. You must not allow them to leave here alive.

NEW MISSION OBJECTIVE:
- Destroy the Terran encampment.
