## Mission Briefing

KERRIGAN:

DAGGOTH:

> Kerrigan, Zasz is dead!

KERRIGAN:

> Oh? It is a pity that Cerebrates cannot truly be killed. I expect that the Overmind will reincarnate him soon.

DAGGOTH:

KERRIGAN:

> So. Tassadar's plan was merely a diversion. I should not have underestimated him so.

DAGGOTH:

> Without its master, Zasz's Brood has run amok and even now threatens the Hive cluster. Cerebrate, you must eradicate the rampaging Brood and stem any further damage it might cause. I shall deal with the Protoss myself.
