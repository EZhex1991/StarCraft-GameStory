## Mission Briefing

> OVERMIND:
>> Behold the power of that which is yet unborn! For the swirling images that flow forth from the Chrysalis are only a shadow of the sleeper's true power.

> ZASZ:
>> The psionic emanations of the Chrysalis have reached out into the depths of space and lured our enemies to us! Even now, we are aware of their plans:

> DUKE:
>> All right. All squadrons close formation and scan for hostiles. Emperor Arcturus believes that there's Zerg out here, so it's our job to flush 'em out! I don't want any slip-ups this time! We'll show these critters that they can't run from the Terran Dominion!

> DAGGOTH:
>> Engage the Terran forces with care. Your priority is to protect the Chrysalis at all costs.

## Objectives

> - Protect the Chrysalis
> - Eliminate the Terran presence

## Mission

_After destorying most of the Terran buildings_

> DUKE:
>> All right you sorry bastards! Fall Back! Fall Back!

> DAGGOTH:
>> Hold, Cerebrate. Do not pursue them.

> ZASZ:
>> Cerebrate, you must stay and relocate the Chrysalis to a more secure location. Daggoth shall deal with the remaining Terran Forces.
