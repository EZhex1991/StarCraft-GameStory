# Full Circle

Zerg Swarm  
High orbit over Protoss Homeworld of Aiur

## Mission Briefing

OVERMIND:

> You have done well, my Cerebrate. The Protoss can do nothing but flee before the onslaught of the Swarm. But now you must assault one final site before our conquest is assured.
>
> Behold, there is a temple, not far from here, that lies upon ground most hallowed. Though I have born witness to the passing of countless millenia, the temple which you must assault is older by far. For it was constructed by my creators, the Xel'Naga, and it marks the site where the Xel'Naga first set foot upon Aiur.
>
> The temple must be cleared, and the Khaydarin Crystal set in its place. Only then shall the way be made ready. For it is upon that ground alone that I may be manifest.

OVERMIND:

> Now shall the events set into motion so long agi be made complete. For the Protoss too, were created by the Xel'Naga. They were the first creation, gifted with a purity of form. And we were the second creation, blessed with a purity of essence. Indeed, our two species are but opposite facets of a greater whole. Soon shall our two races be made as one. Thenceforth shall all feel the wrath of the eternal Swarm... For the hour of judgement is come!
