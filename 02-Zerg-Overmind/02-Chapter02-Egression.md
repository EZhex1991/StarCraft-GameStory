Confederate Capitol World Tarsonis

## Mission Briefing

OVERMIND:

> I am well pleased young Cerebrate, and so long as my prize remains intact, I shall remain pleased. Thus, its life and yours shall be made as one. As it prospers, so shall you. For you are part of the Swarm. If ever your flesh should fail, that flesh shall be made anew. That is my covenant with all Cerebrates.

> Now you have grown strong enough to bear the rigors of warp travel with the Swarm. Thus we shall make our exit from this blasted world and secure the Chrysalis within the Hive cluster, upon the planet Char.

ZASZ:

> Remnants of the Protoss fleet still linger within this planet's orbit. They will attempt to block our exodus at every turn.

DAGGOTH:

> My Brood shall aid you, Cerebrate, Should you require assistance.

_Bring the Chrysalis to the beacon_

ZASZ:

> Prepare yourself, Cerebrate. Your first jump through warp space could be... unsettling.
